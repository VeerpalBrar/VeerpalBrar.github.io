## The Boring Version: 
I'm a computer science student at the University of Toronto. 
I'm familiar with Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and I'm in the process of learning node.js and flask. 

## The Interesting Version: 
I'm a self proclaimed Ravenclaw who started programming on a whim and never stopped. I love the logic and creativity behind programming and spend my time scanning the internet for random tibits of information about cryptography, machine learning, web development and more! I try to take what I learn and use it to build things with code. 

You'll find me reading science fictiion, watching too much television, or writing poetry when I'm not busy
coding.
