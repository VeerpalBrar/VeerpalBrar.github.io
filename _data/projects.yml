- name: Markov Chain
  date: Winter 2016
  description: Implemented a program to generated random sentences using a markov chain. The program reads a text file and creates a transition matrix, using n-grams. It then generates new text based on the transition matrix. This was my first try at creating a computer program that can write poetry.
  languages: Written in python using numpy and ntlk.
    
- name: SafetyTab 
  date: Summer 2016
  description: Safety Tab is a Google Chrome extension that allows users to quickly load a website from a predetermined list in a new tab. This is perfect for when you need to pretend to do homework as your parents look over your shoulder!

  languages: Python

- name: CodeNotes
  date: Fall 2015
  description: CodeNotes is a dual purpose editor for computer science students. It allows for rich text editing as well as text-editing for code. This is perfect when a student needs to take detailed and organized notes while also quickly typing up some code. CodeNotes is my first project written in JavaScript and Local Storage. Looking back, I’m pretty embarrassed by the code, but so proud of all the things I learned.
  languages: Javascipt, HTML, CSS
