For the last three months I have been working for the Ministry of Transportation as a web developer. Going into this experience I thought I'd mainly be learning about the web development process - you know, learn the various technologies and technicalality of running and maintaining a website. While I have learnt all about that, I discovered that one of the most important aspects of development is a technical skill but rather communication.

Technical programming skills and actually coding are only a part of web development. Another equally important part is how the web developers communicates with not only their team but also other non technical members of the organization.
