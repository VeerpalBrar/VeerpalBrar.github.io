            <h4>Web Development Assistant - Ministry of Transporation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I worked on COAnalysis project which is a GUI that
                allows the users to parses excel files listing Ministry
                Content Owners to obtain relevant data. The tool was
                created to help in the content review process.
                    <p>Languages: Python (uses wxPython for GUI)</p>
                </li>
                <li>I created HTML versions for all Road Talk issues from
                2016-2010. The aim was to replace the PDF issues with a
                more accessible format.</li>
                <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                    <p>Languages: HTML, CSS</p>

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
            <h4>SafetyTab</h4>
            <p>SafetyTab is a Google Chrome extension that allows users to
            quickly load a website from a predetermined list in a new tab.
            This is perfect for when you need to pretend to do homework as
            your parents look over your shoulder!</p>
            <p>This project was a fun idea I decided to play around with
            while I experimented with asynchronous programming in
            JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Languages: Javascipt, HTML, CSS + Chrome's Javascript
            API's</p>

        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
            <h4>CodeNotes</h4>
            <p>CodeNotes is a dual purpose editor for computer science
            students. It allows for rich text editing as well as
            text-editing for code. This is perfect when a student needs to
            take detailed and organized notes while also quickly typing up
            some code.</p>
            <p>CodeNotes is my first project written in JavaScript and
            Local Storage. Looking back, Iâ€™m pretty embarrassed by the
            code, but so proud of all the things I learned.</p>

            <p>Learn X in Y Minutes is a quick way to get caught up in the
            syntax of any programming language. I updated the Python 3 page
            to include information the step parameter of the range
            function.</p>

                    <p>I created a geometry formulae cheat sheet that
                    appears as an instant answer on the Duck Duck Go search
                    answer when one searches 'geometry formula cheat
                    sheet'.</p>

                    file.</p>

                    <p>I enhanced the RandWord Instant Answer so that when
                    the users asks for a random word, the definition is
                    also provided. The Instant Answer utilizes the WordNik

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I created a new Sass Fathead Instant Answer, which
                    provides quick answers to Sass related search query's
                    by parsing the Sass documentation.</p>
                    <p>Language: The parser was written using python.</p>
