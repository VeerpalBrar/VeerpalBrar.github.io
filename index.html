    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="entry">
        <h3 id="the-boring-version">The Boring Version:</h3>
        <p>I’m a computer science specialist and a statistics minor at the
        University of Toronto. I’m familiar with Python, Java, JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <h3 id="the-interesting-version">The Interesting Version:</h3>
        <p>Hello World! I am a self proclaimed Ravenclaw who started
        programming on a whim and never stopped. I love the logic and
        creativity behind programming.</p>
        
        I let my curiosity drive my learning, and
        then I take what I learn and use it to build awesome things with
        code.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m learning about markov chains so I can get computers
        to write poetry for me.</p>
        <p>You’ll find me reading science fictiion, watching too much
        television, or writing stories when I’m not busy coding.</p>
