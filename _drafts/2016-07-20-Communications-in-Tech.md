For the last three months I have been working for the Ministry of Transportation as a web developer. Going into this experience I thought I'd mainly be learning about the web development process - you know, learn the various technologies and technicalality of running and maintaining a website.

While I have learnt all about that, I discovered that technical programming skills and actually coding are only a part of web development. Another equally important part is how the web developers communicates with not only their team but also other non technical members of the organization. 

Now, I think all developers know what you have to be able to communicate timelines and deadlines. But communication goes further then that in a way that is not often considered. For example:
- How will your team communicate with people in non-technical positions? While members of IT might understand techincal jargon, people outside the tech sphere will not. For example, when I was asked to help someone implement a rotating banner on a sharepoint site, I thought this was rather simple. I wrote up the code and passed it along, assuming the person on the other end would understand it. As it turns out, we had different levels of techincal knowledge and I ended up confusing the person rather then helping them!

- You will need to write report and fill out forms. This means you need to be able to write a clear and consise form that articulate your ideas to your audience - weather techinical or not. This means having a understanding of proper grammar and sentence structure. I think student often write a program that works great but then they don't do that great on the report and documentation part. This is not acceptable because a large part of the day to day will require you to communicate clearly. 

- When you talk you need to clear. I mean CLEAR. You can't tell a someone you have a great idea but "you just don't know how to put into words". So often, my peers and I will write a great peice of code, but when it comes to actually explaining what it does, we stumble over our words. We end up explaining line by line what is happening rather then explaining the purpose of the code. That just doesn't work anymore. Not only do you need to know how to code what you are doing but you need to be able to explain it as well. 

While these items seems basic they account for such a large part of the work day. The stereotyp eof the solitary programmer simpily is not correct. In the day to day you have to speak to team makes, co-workers and clients. That means having some strong communications skills. Sadly, communicating is something everyone thinks they know how to do even though most people could be much better at it.
