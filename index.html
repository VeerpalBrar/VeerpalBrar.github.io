    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <h2 id="the-boring-version">The Boring Version:</h2>
        <p>I’m a computer science specialist and a mathematics minor at the
        University of Toronto. I’m familiar with Python, Java, JavaScript,
        HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <h2 id="the-interesting-version">The Interesting Version:</h2>
        <p>Hello World! I am a self proclaimed Ravenclaw who started
        programming on a whim and never stopped. I love the logic and
        creativity behind programming and spend my time scanning the internet
        for random tibits of information about cryptography, machine learning,
        web development and more! I let my curiosity drive my learning, and
        then I take what I learn and use it to build awesome things with
        code.</p>
        <p>Currently, I’m learning about markov chains so I can get computers
        to write poetry for me.</p>
        <p>You’ll find me reading science fictiion, watching too much
        television, or writing poetry when I’m not busy coding.</p>
