### About Me

The Boring About Me: I'm a computer science student at the University of Toronto. 
I'm familiar with Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and I'm in teh process of learning node.js and flask. 

The Interesting About Me: I'm a curious coder interested in more things then I have time to learn.
I like learning about cryptography, machine learning, web development and more! No matter what I'm learning, 
I'd like to work towards creating interesting things. 

I'm a self proclaimed ravenclaw who likes reading science fictiion and writing poetry when I'm not busy
coding. Other people call me intelligent, hardworking, and responsible, which is also true.
