All newbie programmers hear how they should contribute to open source in order to build their portfolio and give back to the programming community. This is a hundred precent true, but it's also a daunting experience.
I'm going to share my experiences with as a newbie contributor and share some tips that helped me in the process. 

###The First Contribution
A common way to contribute to open source in to submit a pull request on GitHub, where many open source projects are hosted. This requires the use of git, which can be a whole new challenge on top of open source contributions. There is a lot about branching, forking, and commiting that one needs to learn.

This is why I started small for my first contribution. I wanted easy to implement code so I could focus on the git aspect of contributing.

I decided to commits to the python3 page on learnXinYMinutes (LINK!!!!!!). Since I was already familar with python syntax it was easy for me to find a small detail that could be added to the project. I noticed that the range function explaintation did not provide information on the step parameter. I decided I could add in  the explantaion. 

Then came the harder part. There are a lot of resources out there about using git. I read a bunch of them and tried to get a grasp on how git worked and want order I needed to use the commands.

In particular I tried to learn about setting up git (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) forking (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), branching (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell), commiting (http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/chap-005-extract.html), pushing(https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) and creating a pull request(https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). 

I basically followed instruction I found online, forked the learnXinYMinutes, made changes and then created a pull request. Actually, I remember at one point I was getting so confused I had to delete everything and start over again. I had a lot of questions and it took me a whole weekend to figure out the process. But in the end, I made my pull request and got it merged!

###The Second Contribution 
So learnXinYMinutes was technically my first open source contribution. I made a couple more documentation related contributions such as for the FreeCodeCamp wiki (LINK!!!). But contributing to open source is more then just learning git. Another part of contributing is finding things to fix in code and I didn't want to be only fixing documentation. 

I think that this is something many newcomers struggle with. Projects usually have large code bases that
