  date: fall 2015
  description: CodeNotes is a dual purpose editor for computer science students. It allows for rich text editing as well as text-editing for code. This is perfect when a student needs to take detailed and organized notes while also quickly typing up some code. CodeNotes is my first project written in JavaScript and Local Storage. Looking back, Iâ€™m pretty embarrassed by the code, but so proud of all the things I learned.
