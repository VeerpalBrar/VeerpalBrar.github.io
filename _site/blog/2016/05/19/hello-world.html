<div class="post">
  <p>For my first post, I figured I’d start with “hello world” in true coding fashion.</p>

<p>It makes sense considering that I’m starting to learn how to use Jekyll build my personal website. Might as well start by learning how to say “hello world”.</p>

<p>I remember my first “hello world” program. It was in grade 11 when I was starting my introduction to computer science course. I was taking the course on a whim - the other courses I wanted to take were already full. I must admit, my first “hello world” didn’t feel all that special. I was filled with the wonder of having a computer do what I told it to. Growing up with technology, I was use to computers doing what I told them to.</p>

<p>No, for me the wonder of programming started after I’d learned more of the basics. It started when for my first assignment, I was told to create a “high-low” guessing game. For the first time, rather then writing five word programs that did seemingly trivial things with no real application, I was <strong>creating</strong> something that actually had a real purpose. Sure, it wasn’t easy. There was a lot of fustrating and debugging and staring at the screen blankly that I had to do. Yet, in the end, it was totally worth it.</p>

<p>As someone who wanted to spend her life being creative, I was often fustrated with my lack of artistic ability. Painting and drawing didn’t come as easy to me as logic and math. Just when I though I was doomed to the life of a consumer rather then creator, I learned that I could use logic and math to create thing that other people would use and enjoy. After that, I was hooked to programming.</p>
