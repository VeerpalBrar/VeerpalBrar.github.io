For my first post, I figured I'd start with "hello world" in true coding fashion. 

It makes sense considering that I'm starting to learn how to use Jekyll build my personal website. Might as well start by learning how to say "hello world".

I remember my first "hello world" program. It was in grade 11 when I was starting my introduction to computer science course. I was taking the course on a whim - the other courses I wanted to take were already full. I must admit, my first "hello world" didn't feel all that special. I was filled with the wonder of having a computer do what I told it to. Growing up with technology, I was use to computers doing what I told them to. 

No, for me the wonder of programming started after I'd learned more of the basics. It started when for my first assignment, I was told to create a "high-low" guessing game. For the first time, rather then writing five word programs that did seemingly trivial things with no real application, I was **creating** something that actually had a real purpose. Sure, it wasn't easy. There was a lot of fustrating and debugging and staring at the screen blankly that I had to do. Yet, in the end, it was totally worth it. 

As someone who wanted to spend her life being creative, I was often fustrated with my lack of artistic ability. Painting and drawing didn't come as easy to me as logic and math. Just when I though I was doomed to the life of a consumer rather then creator, I learned that I could use logic and math to create thing that other people would use and enjoy. After that, I was hooked to programming.
